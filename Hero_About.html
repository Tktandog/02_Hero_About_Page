		<h2>John Wick's Abilities</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Peak Human Strength: Despite not as great as his durability and stamina John's strength is still great. He can easily lift and overpower full-grown, overpower much taller and stronger opponents, easily retrain humans and break their bones, as well as effortlessly break a glass and snap necks.</li>
			<li>Peak Human Durability: Considering his physical condition, John's body is also very durable as he was able to survive (despite being critically injured) from falling off the Continental Hotel while colliding with other objects before landing flat on the concrete floor. Another example was shown when despite being stabbed and shot multiple times, he didn't lose any of his strengths.</li>
			<li>Peak Human Stamina: John has a tremendous amount of stamina which allows him to run for great distance and fight for a considerable amount of time with multiple skilled opponents a walk away victorious. Even after being injured and tired, John needs a minimal break only to recover and can move a fight again. He can fight at his peak until he falls from wounds or complete exhaustion.</li>
